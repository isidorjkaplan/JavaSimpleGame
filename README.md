# JavaSimpleGame
A simple graphical video game I wrote in Grade 10 in Java. 

Not really representitive of current abilities as it was a long time ago (4+ years), but I figure better to add the project then not to. 

I don't have any README, I don't remember how this program works. If I manage to dig up the instructions from when I submitted it in Grade 10 I will attach them.
